"""Build and dispatch validated canonical DiffGraph artifacts.

The structural producer and contract validator meet here so a CLI invocation
constructs one artifact, validates it once, and then hands the same validated
value to its selected consumer.  This module is deliberately local-only: it
imports no AI SDK or network-capable DiffGraph module.
